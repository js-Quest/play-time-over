  ## Description
  This is a 2-D arcade-style animated video game!  Unlike other aarcade games, this does not cost you money.  You do however have to log in and present an email and password.  For the game: You are a seahorse that shoots fireballs (press 'spacebar' to shoot).  You move up and down on the Y-axis (press 'ArrowUp' or 'ArrowDown' to move) as the game scrolls on the X-axis.  You destroy other fish and get points.  There is a hard time-limit at 30 seconds for you to collect as many points as possible.  If you have a high enough score, your score will be displayed on the Leaderboard the next time you play.  If your score reaches the winning threshold, you will receive a message.  If you do not reach the threshold, you will receive some shade.  There are two levels (one is a 'secret' level, the difficulty is scaled). If you press the 'D' button on the keyboard, you can view the character hit-boxes in real time.  Please be conscious of the volume level, as there are sound effects and music (you can toggle the music on/off by clicking anywhere on the screen).  
  
  This app uses node.js, express.js, handlebars, MySql, Sequelize ORM, express-session, HTML5 Canvas methods, and MaterializeCSS.
